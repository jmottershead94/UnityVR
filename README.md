# UnityVR

### What is this repository for?
This is a repository for my honours project, which is investigating the effectiveness of VR games development.

### How am I going to test this?
For this project I have created an example game which testers will play. There are 6 levels in total, 3 have been created using the standard Unity Editor, and the other 3 have been created using this prototype VR tool.

The times for these level creations have been recorded and these times will be compared to help see if developing in VR has provided any advantages over developing in the standard editor.

### Features
* **Basic VR Level Editing**: Grab and Free Form modes.
* **Primitive Manipulation**: Translation, Rotation and Scaling.
* **3D Menu**: Access to Primitives, Colours, Prefabs and Lights.
* **Example Game**: An example FPS game.

### Example FPS Game
In the assets folder, there is an examples folder which holds an example FPS game created for testing for this honours project. This game is called Speedster Gunslinger, and involves the player fighting off enemies and trying to survive. Although it will be easier since you are faster than everyone else - and their bullets! This example has:
* FPS gameplay.
* Basic enemies with raycasting line of sight.
* 6 levels (3 created using the standard Unity Editor, and 3 created using the tool developed for this project).
