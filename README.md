# UnityVR
This is a public repository for my honours project.

* **Unity 5.4.1**, available [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive), this is the version that I am using to develop this plugin.
* **SourceTree**, available [here](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), this will allow me to maintain source code and provide a UI on top of Git.
* **Trello**, available [here](https://trello.com/b/H0P1csgL/honours-project), is how I shall organise and maintain tasks.
